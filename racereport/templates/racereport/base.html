            What is this?  Every day in Zwift racing, thousands of riders push themselves to their physical limits so their virtual avatar moves a few pixels faster than a stranger half a world away.  
            The pulse is about celebrating each of those highly individual stories, and weaving them into a collection of bigger narratives on which communities are built.

            We will get to the story-telling, as a first step it's about using data to understand the big picture of <strong>"what happened yesterday in Zwift Racing?"</strong>
